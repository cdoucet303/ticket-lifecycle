<p>
The first step is submitting a ticket as one of the user we created in the last lab.

</p>
<p>
After the ticket is submitted we will go to our log in screen for osTicket and log in as Jane Doe the Agent with lesser permissions to see if we can see the ticket that has been submitted. After logging in we notice the ticket query is empty. Now I am going to log out of Jane doe and log in as John Doe and I should be able to see the ticket.

<p>
Now that I can see the Ticket as Admin John Doe I will click on it and select priority levels and assign it to a department and/or an agent. In the red square is where you select Priority, Department, Assigned Agent and SLA. Noticed I assigned it to Jane Doe now we will log in as her and see if we can see it.

<p>
Now as I log in to Jane Doe the first thing I see in the query is the ticket.

<p>
As Jane Doe we can now see all ticket details, reply and keep a timeline of the progress, and close it when it is finished.

<p>
After hitting post reply the ticket will be closed and disappear from the query and as Jane Doe you just have to wait for another ticket to work on!
